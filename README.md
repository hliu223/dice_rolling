This code simulates a simple dice rolling game using Python. It will be a multi-round game which works as the following.

1. Before the game starts, the user is asked to choose the number of players that are going to play the game and respectively asks the names of each player.

2. After successfully setting up the players, the user is prompted to enter the number of rounds the players wish to play.

3. At the end of each round, the game shows the scoreboard containing each playerâ€™s scores per round and their respective total scores.

4. Once the last player has played the last round, the game shows the final scoreboard, congratulates the winner, and asks whether the players want to player another game.
